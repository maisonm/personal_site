          <p>
           This website is built with React, Gatsby, &amp; GraphQL, all hosted via Heroku.
           Blog posts are generated from markdown files that support code block highlighting
           via PrismJS and inserting images. The CSS was written with styled-components. There were no CSS libraries used for the mobile features like the mobile menu. This site is 100% mobile friendly.
           This site will periodically undergo changes and updates as I learn more.

          <h5> React 30-day Bitcoin Price </h5>
          <p>
          A simple Bitcoin price chart built with React, the charting library
          Recharts, and the Coindesk API. All held together with Flexbox.
          The chart has hoverable points that display more data on
          the specific day. It covers the past 30 days, and shows price
          in both USD and EUR. This was one of my first React Projects
          working with a 3rd party API.

          <h5> r/Tronix | Reddit CSS redesign  </h5>
          <p>
           Collaborated with other Reddit members to help write the custom CSS to
           redesign r/Tronix&apos;s CSS layout.
           The goal was to create a minimilistic black/white/grey themed layout.
           Nothing too fancy here, just pure CSS and a fun project to collaborate on!
           Tronix (TRX) is a cryptocurrency, and it&apos;s official subreddit has
           over 67k subscribers currently.

          <h5> React Weather App Tutorial </h5>
          <p>
              This small weather app was built with the intention of being an
              example for a tutorial I wrote
              on Medium. It was less about the weather and more about connecting a
              backend Node Express server with a frontend client like React, and
              sending information back and forth between them.
              It utalizes a 3rd-party weather api via Open Weather
              Map to make weather reuests in the backend.
              The frontend captures a zipcode and then POST&apos;s it to the backend
              that then is used with the weather
              API qOnce the data is returned, it&apos;s fetched by the React component
              responsible for rendering weather display.

          <h5> Golf Handicap Calculator </h5>
          <p>
           This handicap calculator was a tool I made with vanilla Javascript to help me
           quickly gauge where my handicap was after each round of golf.
           There are more complex calcultors out there, but I needed something simple and
           to the point.
           Just the basics here; vanilla Javascript, a bit of math, HTML5, and CSS3.
           I personally use this quite often.
