    <p>
      The scope of my work deals largely with the frontend: React,
      responsive development, SASS/CSS3, Flexbox, Bootstrap, Javascript (ES6), HTML5,
      and all other facets of front-end development like SEO, user experience,
      customer relations, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aside from frontend work, I spend time working to develop my technical skills further.
      I typically like to work on projects utalizing the MERN stack. My goal is to become a
      fullstack Javascript developer at some point in my career! I really
      enjoy solving complex problems, and there is certainly no shortage
      of those in web developement. I consider myself a quick learner, and take pride
      in pushing myself to learn new things.
      Outside of web dev, I play and practice quite
      a bit of golf.
      <span> (If you want to play golf, my answer is not no.) </span>

      I am available for contact anytime via email. You can view my email, Github,
