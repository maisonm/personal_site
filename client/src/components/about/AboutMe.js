    <p>
      The scope of my work deals largely with the frontend: Javascript (ES6),
      React, consuming API's, SASS/CSS3, HTML5, Flexbox, Responsive Design, and
      Wordpress Theme Development. Backend wise, I have experience using NodeJS
      and Express and interfacing routes with a frontend client like React. I
      have experience with MongoDB and interfacing with it via Mongoose.

      I really enjoy solving complex problems, and there is certainly no
      shortage of those in web developement. I consider myself a quick learner,
      and take pride in pushing myself to learn new things on my own and from
      others around me. Outside of web dev, I play quite a bit of golf.
