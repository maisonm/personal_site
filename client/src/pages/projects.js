              <h5> r/Tronix | Reddit CSS redesign  </h5>
              <p>
                 Collaborated with other Reddit members to help write the custom CSS to
                 redesign r/Tronix&apos;s CSS layout.
                 The goal was to create a minimilistic black/white/grey themed layout.
                 Nothing too fancy here, just pure CSS and a fun project to collaborate on!

              <p>
                 This website is built with React, Gatsby, &amp; GraphQL, all hosted via Heroku.
                 Blog posts are generated from markdown files that support code block highlighting
                 via PrismJS and inserting images. The CSS was written with styled-components.
                 This site periodically undergoes changes and updates as I learn more.

              <h5> React Weather App Tutorial </h5>
              <p>
                    This small weather app was built with the intention of being an example for a tutorial I wrote
                    on Medium. It was less about the weather and more about connecting a
                    backend Node Express server with a frontend client like React, and
                    sending information back and forth between them.
                    It utalizes a 3rd-party weather api via Open Weather
                    Map to make weather reuests in the backend.
                    The frontend captures a zipcode and then POST&apos;s it to the backend
                    that then is used with the weather
                    API qOnce the data is returned, it&apos;s fetched by the React component
                    responsible for rendering weather display.

              <h5> Golf Handicap Calculator </h5>
              <p>
                 This handicap calculator was a tool I made with vanilla Javascript to help me
                 quickly gauge where my handicap was after each round of golf.
                 There are way better calcultors out there, but I needed something simple and
                 to the point.
                 Just the basics here; vanilla Javascript, a bit of math, HTML5, and CSS3.
                 I personally use this quite often.
