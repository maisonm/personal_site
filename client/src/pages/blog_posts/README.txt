## Rules For Adding Blog Post

1: Blog .md files are named by date in this format: _mm-dd-yy_
   
   ####Adding Blog Post Assets
   - New blog posts mean new assets directories. The asset directory name will be the same name as the blog .md file that it corresponds to.
   - All new post assets directories go into blog_posts/assets/blog_post_media

2: Must include this frontmatter format in every blog .md file:

   path: '/path'
   author: 'Your Name'
   title: 'Blog Title'
   date: 'September 12th, 2018'
   tags: [ must be an array - max 4 tags ]
   description: '< 150 char description of the blog post'

   _The date format is: Month Day, Year_
